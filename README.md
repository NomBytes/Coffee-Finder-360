#Welcome to the Coffee-Finder-360 wiki!

Welcome to the wiki for the Coffee Finder 360 app development team. We are commited to the development of a high quality sample application based on Java/Postgreql.


Our team will offer a website for coffee shop reviews. We plan to include searching by name, physical location, coordinate location, vicinity, and a general name search. We also plan to include a review system that incorporates food quality, beverage quality, and value. This review system will be searchable as well by a few different methods.
